* Proven track record in conducting security reviews or vulnerability assessments on Solidity codebases.
* Strong understanding of common vulnerabilities in smart contracts (e.g., reentrancy, integer overflow, access control issues).
* Familiarity with Ethereum-based decentralized systems and blockchain protocols.
* Experience with blockchain security tools (e.g., Slither, Certora prover, Foundry, Echidna) and manual code review.
* Excellent problem-solving skills and attention to detail.
Strong communication skills, including the ability to write clear and comprehensive security reports.

The ideal candidate would be an experienced security assessor and a passionate advocate of the Solidity programming language. We are seeking someone who is enthusiastic about contributing to the security of software at the heart of prominent Blockchain projects.

### Preferred Qualifications:

* Prior experience in security roles related to blockchain or Ethereum.
* Knowledge of cryptography and its application in smart contracts.

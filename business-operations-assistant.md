# Wanted: Business Operations Assistant (Part-time or Full-time)

Sigma Prime is hiring a Business Operations Assistant to help optimise and support the smooth running of our internal operations.

This is an exceptional opportunity for a talented self-starter to work alongside some of the brightest minds in blockchain, hone their skills in the cybersecurity space, and join a dynamic tech company at the forefront of decentralised innovation.

## About Us

Sigma Prime is an information security consultancy that provides specialist distributed systems expertise. We are a team of developers, researchers, and security engineers who have come together with the purpose of building a secure and decentralised world.

Ethereum has been a focus of ours since 2015 and we have provided security assessment, design consultancy, and niche development services to prominent companies in the space.

We're also the founders and maintainers of Lighthouse, an Ethereum consensus client built in Rust.

## The Role

As a Business Operations Assistant at Sigma Prime, you'll support the company’s daily operations, working closely with the leadership team and other cross-functional teams. You will play a key part in fostering collaboration, helping us stay organised, and supporting a high-performance team environment.

* Proven experience in operations or administration, ideally in a tech or startup environment.
* Previous remote work experience is a plus.
* Strong organisational and communication skills, with attention to detail.
* Ability to prioritise tasks in a fast-paced environment.
* A proactive, problem-solving approach, with the ability to work independently.
* A customer-focused mindset and professionalism.
* Interest in cybersecurity and/or blockchain technologies.

# Wanted: Devops Engineer

Sigma Prime is hiring a devops engineer to join our team.

This is an excellent opportunity for a devops engineer to align with some of
the brightest minds in blockchain and develop the skills to work alongside
developers in decentralized networks.

## The Company

**Sigma Prime** was established in 2016 and provides information security and
niche development services to some of the biggest names in Ethereum and DeFi.
[Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse), our Beacon Chain
implementation, is a key piece of Ethereum infrastructure. Our engineers have
world-class knowledge of Ethereum staking and maintain high performance
validators across several testing and production environments.

## The Role

To work alongside and assist developers in building core decentralised
network infrastructure. 

The nature of our work requires small-scale and large-scale network testing and
monitoring. As a devops engineer, your role will be to create testnets,
devnets, tooling and monitoring systems to help developers identify issues and
verify software implementations in a variety of network conditions. 

In addition, we run high-performance production instances of our software which
require maintenance, monitoring and a very high standard of security practices and
processes.

Apart from assisting developers, building and maintaining production
infrastructure, we hope the candidate has an interest in improving current
designs. We always welcome new ideas, practices, tooling improvements and offer
time for the candidate to find new and improved ways of improving our devops
infrastructure. 

The current tooling relies heavily on **Ansible** and testnets are now favouring
**Kurtosis**. Internally we rely heavily on Docker, we use various cloud
providers and occasionally Kubernetes. Experience with all of these
technologies is not required but is favourable.

## The Candidate

In order to improve coverage of a round-the-clock devops team, we currently
have a strong preference for a candidate that can work in the APAC timezone.

The ideal candidate should have:

1. **Ansible experience**
	- Competent with Ansible workspaces, playbooks and other core concepts.
	- Competent with the Jinja2 templating language.
	- Competent with building and maintaining YAML documents.
1. **Linux experience**
    - Highly competent with the Linux shell.
	- Highly competent with `systemd`, `journald`, etc.
	- Highly competent with server security concepts (e.g., firewalls, public
		key authentication, vulnerability patching etc.).
	- Highly competent with networking fundamentals (e.g., subnetting).
	- Competent with DNS and managing domains.
1. **Blockchain experience**
    - Competent with blockchain data structures (e.g., blocks, forks, etc).
	- Competent with blockchain signature schemes (e.g., high-level
		understanding of ECDSA).
	- Competent with blockchain P2P networks (e.g., high-level understanding of
		peers and how they are discovered).

Candidates with extensive devops experience but low-level blockchain experience
will be considered. Candidates who cannot demonstrate an interest in Ethereum
need not apply, enthusiasm is critical.

Candidates must be self-driven and motivated to learn about and improve the
systems around them. We provide high-level strategic guidance and constructive
feedback, however we do not micro-manage our team members. Candidates are
responsible for their own day-to-day activities.

Candidates must be proficient in technical conversations in English, both
written and verbal. *Perfect* English is not a requirement, accents keep things
interesting :)

No jerks, trolls or bullies.

## Locations

The candidate is free to choose between being remote or local in Sydney. Remote
work is an essential part of our company culture. Those who work remotely still
form an integral part of the team.

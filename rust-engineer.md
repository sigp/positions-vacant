## The Role

We are looking for an experienced rust engineer who shares our passion for
decentralised systems, and whose development skills complement those of our

* Have familiarity with the rust-libp2p framework
* Possess a keen interest in information security
* Have a practical knowledge of cryptographic signature schemes

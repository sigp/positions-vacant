# Wanted: Rust Engineer

Sigma Prime is hiring a software engineer, who has prior experience with the Rust programming language, to develop open-source software.

## The Company

**Sigma Prime** is a boutique information security firm who provide specialist
blockchain expertise. We are a team of developers, researchers, and security
engineers who have come together with the purpose of building a secure and
decentralised world.

Ethereum has been a focus of ours since 2015 and we have provided security
reviews, design consultancy, and niche development services to prominent
companies in the space, both locally and internationally.

We build and maintain Lighthouse, which is an Ethereum 2.0 client built using Rust. The
project is well established and considered one of the leading implementations
in production today; the open-source repository can be found at
[github.com/sigp/lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse).

We also build and maintain Anchor, which is an SSV client built using Rust. The repository can be found here:

We are a safe place regardless of your ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or
any other characteristic that makes you happy and harms no-one.

## The Role

We are looking for an experienced rust engineer who shares our passion for
decentralised systems, and whose development skills complement those of our
team.

You may fit the role if you:

* Are experienced in developing applications using Rust. i.e. you’re able to implement complex functions in idiomatic Rust
* Are familiar with asynchronous Rust
* Are interested or have experience in distributed systems, p2p networks and/or exposure to various networking protocols
* Have familiarity with the rust-libp2p framework
* Possess a keen interest in information security
* Have a practical knowledge of cryptographic signature schemes
* Are passionate about Ethereum, proof-of-stake blockchains, and/or decentralised systems

This role is for a developer whose primary objective will be to contribute towards development of decentralized staking systems. There is multiple areas of work that can be undertaken based on preference. For example, distributed networks, consensus mechanisms, optimizations etc.

The ideal candidate would be an Ethereum enthusiast with decent experience in
Rust programming, who is looking to become a team of world-class blockchain
engineers.
